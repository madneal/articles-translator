In this article we will learn about the concept of closures in JavaScript, we will see how functions can be stateful with persistent data across multiple executions. We will also explore some of the popular use cases of closure and different approaches for using them.

Lets start with a quote from [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Closures):

> A closure is the combination of a function bundled together (enclosed) with references to its surrounding state (the lexical environment). In other words, a closure gives you access to an outer function’s scope from an inner function. In JavaScript, closures are created every time a function is created, at function creation time.

If you ask me, i would say that closures enables us to create stateful functions.

在本文中，我们将学习 JavaScript 中闭包的概念，我们将了解具有持久化数据函数如何在多个执行中的实现状态化。我们还将探讨闭包的一些流行用例以及它们的不同使用方法。

让我们先看一段 [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Closures) 中的介绍：

> 闭包是打包在一起（封闭）的函数及其周围状态（词法环境）的组合。换句话说，闭包使你可以从内部函数访问外部函数的作用域。在 JavaScript 中，每次创建函数时都会在函数创建时创建闭包。

如果你问我，我会说闭包使我们能够创建状态函数。

## Stateful functions

## 状态函数

Stateful functions are functions that can “remember” data from previous executions. For example lets create a function that “remembers” and count how many times it got executed, each time that we will invoke it, it will log the number of times it got executed.

To do that, we will need some kind of a counter variable that will hold the current number of executions and will get incremented every time we invoke the function, the challenge here is to decide on where to put this variable.

Lets explore our first approach:

状态函数可以“记住”之前执行中的数据。例如，让我们创建一个“记住”并统计执行次数的函数，每次调用该函数时，它都会记录执行次数。

为此，我们将需要某种计数器变量，该计数器变量将保存当前的执行次数，并且每次调用该函数时都会递增计数，这里的挑战是确定将该变量放在何处。

让我们探索我们的第一种方法：

```
function counter(){
  let numOfExecutions = 0;
  numOfExecutions++;
  console.log(numOfExecutions);
}

counter() // 1
counter() // 1
```

Obviously this won’t work well, because we are re-creating the numOfExecutions variable every time we invoke counter().

显然，这个方法行不通，因为每次调用 `counter()` 时，我们都会重新创建 `numOfExecutions` 变量。

## Execution context

Every time we invoke a function, a new execution context is created, and each execution context has it’s own “Variable Environment” or “scope” if you will. This local variable environment is holding all arguments that got passed to it and all declarations made inside the body of the function, in our case the numOfExecutions variable. When the function is “done”, e.g with a return statement or there are no more lines of code to execute, the engine will mark it to be garbage collected, meaning it’s entire environment will get disposed.

This is the reason our code above doesn’t work well, every time we invoke counter we create a new execution context with a new declaration of the numOfExecutions variable and incrementing it to the value of 1.

## 执行上下文

每次调用函数时，都会创建一个新的执行上下文，并且每个执行上下文都有自己的“变量环境”或“作用域”。这个局部变量环境保存着传递给它的所有参数以及在函数体内进行的所有声明，在我们的例子中是 `numOfExecutions` 变量。当函数“完成”时（例如，使用 return 语句或没有其它执行代码），引擎会将其标记为垃圾回收，这意味着整个环境都将被丢弃。

这就是我们上面的代码无法正常工作的原因，每次我们调用计数器时，我们都会使用 `numOfExecutions` 变量的新声明创建一个新的执行上下文，并将其递增为1。

## Global execution context

When we start our program, the engine will create a global execution context for us, its not different from the execution context we create when we invoke a function. It also has a “Variable Environment” just like any other execution context, the difference is that the global execution context will never “die” (as long as our program is running of course), hence it’s variable environment won’t get disposed by the garbage collector.

So knowing that, we can maybe store our numOfExecutions in the global variable environment, this way we know it won’t get re-created each time we invoke counter.

## 全局执行上下文

当我们启动程序时，引擎将为我们创建一个全局执行上下文，它与调用函数时创建的执行上下文差不多。就像任何其他执行上下文一样，它也具有“变量环境”，不同之处在于全局执行上下文永远不会“消亡”（当然只要我们的程序正在运行），因此它的变量环境不会被回收。

因此知道，我们可以将 `numOfExecutions` 存储在全局变量环境中，这样我们就知道每次调用 `counter` 时都不会重新创建它。

```
let numOfExecutions = 0;

function counter(){
  numOfExecutions++;
  console.log(numOfExecutions);
}

counter() // 1
counter() // 2
```

This works as we expect, we get the correct number of invocations, but you probably already know that storing variables on the global environment is considered as bad practice. For example see what happens if another function wants to use the exact same variable:

这可以按我们预期的那样工作，可以得到正确的调用次数，但是你可能已经知道，将变量存储在全局环境中被认为是不正确的做法。例如，看看另一个函数想要使用完全相同的变量会发生什么：

```
let numOfExecutions = 0;

function counter() {
  numOfExecutions++;
  console.log(numOfExecutions);
}

function someFunc() {
  numOfExecutions = 100;
}

someFunc()
counter() // 101
counter() // 102
```

As you can see we get some wrong numbers in here.

Another issue with this approach is that we can’t run more than 1 instance of counter.

## Lexical Scope

Lexical Scope is basically a fancy way of saying “Static Scope”, meaning we know at creation time what is the scope of our function.

Read this carefully:

> **WHERE** you define your function, determines what variables the function have access to **WHEN** it gets called.

In other words, it doesn’t matter where and how you invoke the function, its all about where did it got declared.

But how do we declare a function in one place, and invoke it in another place? Well, we can create a function within a function and return it:

如你所见，我们在这里得到一些错误的数字。

这种方法的另一个问题是，我们不能运行一个以上的 `counter` 实例。

## 词法作用域

词法作用域基本上是说“静态范围”的一种高级说法，这意味着我们在创建时就知道函数的作用域是什么。

请仔细阅读以下内容：

> **在何处定义函数，确定函数在被调用时可以访问哪些变量。

换句话说，无论在何处以及如何调用函数，都与在何处声明函数无关。

但是，我们如何在一个地方声明一个函数，然后在另一个地方调用它呢？ 好吧，我们可以在一个函数内创建一个函数并返回它：

```
function createFunc() {
  function newFunc(){
  
  }
  
  return newFunc;
}

const myFunc = createFunc();
myFunc()
```

It may seem useless, but lets explore the execution phase of our program:

1. We declare a new function with the createFunc label in the global variable environment.
2. We declare a new variable myFunc in the global variable environment which it’s value will be the returned value from the execution of createFunc.
3. We invoke the createFunc function.
4. A new execution context is created (with a local variable environment).
5. We declare a function and giving it a label of newFunc (stored in the local variable environment of createFunc).
6. We return newFunc.
7. The returned value from createFunc is stored as the value of myFunc in the global variable environment.
8. The variable environment of createFunc is marked for disposal (meaning the newFunc variable will not exist).
9. We invoke myFunc.

Note that when we return the function newFunc, we return the actual function definition, not the label.

OK, so what can we do with this approach?

It turns out, that when we return a function, we are not only returning our function definition but we also return it’s entire lexical environment. I.e, if we had some variable declared in the same context (or outer contexts), our returned function would close over them, and keep a reference to them.

Lets see that in action with our counter example:

```
function createCounter() {
  // creating a wrapping execution context
  // so we won't pollute the global environment
  let numOfExecutions = 0;

  // creating and returning an inner function
  // that closes over the lexical environment
  function counter() {
    numOfExecutions++;
    console.log(numOfExecutions);
  }

  return counter;
}

const counter = createCounter();

counter() // 1
counter() // 2
```

As you can see, we are creating a wrapper execution context (createCounter) to store our numOfExecutions variable and we are returning the counter function. This way, every time we invoke counter it has access to the numOfExecutions variable. The fact that we are not re-running createCounter and only run counter let us persist numOfExecutions across executions of counter, thus allow counter to be stateful, meaning we can share data with multiple executions of this function.

If we debug counter’s execution we can see in the developer-tools that numOfExecutions is not stored in the local variable environment of counter but in it’s “Closure” scope, (refers to as [[Scope]] in the spec).

![](https://www.debuggr.io/static/c12daf3075a67fdc790a86b2192f4c32/3d8bd/closure-debug.png)

But what if we wanted to return an object and not a function?

No problem, it will still work as expected:

```
function createCounter() {
  let count = 0;

  function increment() {
    count++;
    return count;
  }

  function decrement() {
    count--;
    return count;
  }

  function reset() {
    count = 0;
  }

  function log() {
    console.log(count)
  }

  const counterObj = {
    increment,
    decrement,
    reset,
    log
  }

  return counterObj;
}

const counter = createCounter();

counter.increment()
counter.increment()
counter.increment()

counter.log() // 3
```

☝️ By the way, this pattern is usually called the “Module Pattern”.

As you can see, it doesn’t matter what we are returning, it doesn’t matter where or when we are calling the functions, the only thing matters is where did we defined our functions:

> **WHERE** you define your function, determines what variables the function have access to **WHEN** it gets called.

Another bonus we get from returning a function or an object with functions is that we can create multiple instances of counter, each will be stateful and share data across executions but won’t conflict between other instances:

```
function createCounter() {
  let numOfExecutions = 0;

  function counter() {
    numOfExecutions++;
    console.log(numOfExecutions);
  }

  return counter;
}

const counter1 = createCounter();
const counter2 = createCounter();

counter1() // 1
counter1() // 2

counter2() // 1
counter2() // 2
```

As you can see, counter1 and counter2 are both stateful but are not conflicting with each others data, something we couldn’t do with a global variable.

## Optimizations

Every returned function is closing over the ENTIRE lexical scope, meaning the entire lexical scope won’t be garbage collected 🤔. This seems like a waste of memory and even a potential memory leak bug, should we re-consider the use of closures every time we need staeful functions?

Well, no. Most if not all browsers are optimizing this mechanism, meaning that in most cases only the variables that your function is actually using will be attached to the function’s [[scope]]. Why in most cases and not all cases? Because in some cases the browser is unable to determine what variables the function is using, such as in case of using eval. Obviously this is the smallest concern of using eval, it is safer to use Function constructor instead.

## Wrapping up

We learned about how “Closure” works under the hood, with a link to the surrounding lexical context. We saw that scope wise, it doesn’t matter when or where we are running our functions but where we are defining them, in other words: Lexical (static) binding. When we return a function, we actually returning not only the function but attach to it the entire lexical variable environment of all surrounding contexts (which browsers optimize and attach only referenced variables). This gives us the ability to create stateful functions with shared data across executions, it also allows us to create “private” variables that our global execution context doesn’t have access to.
